hitTheBee
=========


The objective is to create a PHP application that performs the following tasks:

• A web page must be produced as the interface to play the game.

• A button must be present to kick off the process of hitting a random bee.


To play, there must be a button that enables a user to “hit” a random bee. The selection of a bee must be random. 
When the bees are all dead, the game must be able to reset itself with full life bees for another round.
